          <div class="tip">
            <p><span class="roach">Roaches</span> tend to prefer dark, moist places to hide and breed and can be found behind refrigerators, sinks and stoves, as well as under floor drains and inside of motors and major appliances.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">

          <h4>Precautions</h4>
          <p>Now that you have done the drastic measures you need to be careful. The best way to get rid of <span class="roach">roaches</span>, is to prevent getting them in the first place.</p>
          <p>To help prevent <span class="roach">roaches</span>, is to keep a clean tidy house. Make sure at the end of the you check:</p>
          <ul>

            <li>No food is left out</li>
            <li>Benches are clean</li>
            <li>Floors are swept</li>
